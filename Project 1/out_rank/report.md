# Ranking Reliability Report

- Sources: 5
- Total unique items: 9938
- Max inversions for N items: 49376953

## Methodology
We computed a **combined ranking** by summing per-source ranks (lower sum = better). For each source, we mapped its order to the combined order and counted inversions using two authoritative methods (Merge sort and Fenwick/BIT). A quicksort-style method is included for **diagnostic** insight only.

A **reliability score** is defined as `1 - (inversions / max_inversions)` âˆˆ [0,1]. Higher means closer to the consensus.

## Results (Merge-based)

| source3.txt | 10000 | 20540638 | 0.584004 |
